description: Student-run peer-driven learning environment for data science and engineering in medicine
---

Amid COVID restrictions and an increasing number of remote research opportunities, our [team of engineers](curriculum.html) in medical school banded together to offer a practical and accessible [education](about.html) in coding, engineering, and data science to peers in medical school. We hope that not only will this help you perform innovative research while we work virtually, but also equip you with a lot of the high-demand technical skills that are desirable in medicine, but are in short-supply.

Of course, our team is in medical school right alongside you, so our objective is to teach you valuable skills in short bursts during the most optimal times in our schedule. If you are interested in learning how to code, understanding data science, and/or the fundamentals of engineering, please let us know by filling out this [~3 minute form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeFXp21RKGnyhD02GaYR1vsXuDCLCl9t8aIM8gVLoLXN4qg3A/viewform?usp=sf_link)!

We want to tailor our lessons and skill-building sessions around your needs, so this is a great opportunity to tell us what you would like to learn. ðŸ’»

Additionally, if you would like to contribute to our endeavor by joining our team, we welcome you with open arms! Indicate your interest on the form and we will reach out to you!
